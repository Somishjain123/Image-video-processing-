# Experiment 3: Histogram-based Enhancement

This project focuses on a powerful technique for image enhancement: histogram processing. The goal was to understand and apply histogram equalization to improve image contrast.

### **Project Overview**
The experiment covers two key aspects:
- **Histogram Plotting:** Creating a graphical representation of pixel intensity distribution.
- **Histogram Equalization:** Redistributing pixel values to achieve a more uniform intensity spread, thereby enhancing global image contrast.

The repository includes a detailed analysis of how this technique transforms an image and its histogram to make it more visually appealing and informative.

### **Repository Contents**
- `experiment-3-ivp.pdf`: The complete lab report, which includes the theory, code, and conclusions for this experiment.

### **Skills Highlighted**
- **Histogram Analysis:** Interpreting image quality and contrast from its histogram.
- **Image Enhancement:** Practical application of histogram equalization.
- **Data Visualization:** Understanding how visual representations of data (histograms) can inform image processing decisions.
