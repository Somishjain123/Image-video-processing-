# Experiment 2: Point Processing Techniques

This repository showcases my practical application of point processing techniques for enhancing image quality. These methods manipulate individual pixel values to improve an image's overall appearance.

### **Project Overview**
The primary goal was to apply and analyze various point-wise image transformations, including:
- **Power Law Transformation:** Adjusting image brightness and contrast using gamma correction.
- **Thresholding:** Converting an image to a binary format to separate objects from the background.
- **Contrast Stretching:** Increasing the dynamic range of an image's gray levels to enhance clarity.

### **Repository Contents**
- `experiment-2-ivp.pdf`: The detailed lab report containing the theory, implementation steps, and my findings for this experiment.

### **Skills Highlighted**
- **Image Enhancement:** Expertise in using point processing operations to enhance images.
- **Algorithmic Analysis:** Analyzing the effect of different parameters (e.g., gamma values) on image output.
- **Problem-Solving:** Applying different techniques to solve specific image quality problems, such as low contrast.
