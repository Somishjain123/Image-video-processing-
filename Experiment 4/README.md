# Experiment 4: Spatial Domain Filtering for Noise Reduction

This repository showcases my work on a critical image preprocessing step: noise reduction using spatial domain filtering. This experiment explores how to clean up images corrupted by various types of noise.

### **Project Overview**
The core objective was to apply and analyze the effects of different smoothing filters on images with introduced noise. The experiment specifically deals with:
- **Noise Types:** Handling images corrupted with Gaussian and salt and pepper noise.
- **Filtering Techniques:** Applying smoothing filters like averaging and median filters to reduce noise.
- **Filter Analysis:** Analyzing the effect of different filter mask sizes on the output image (e.g., the trade-off between noise reduction and image blurring).

### **Repository Contents**
- `experiment-4-ivp.pdf`: The complete lab report, providing the theoretical background on noise and filtering, as well as my observations and conclusions.

### **Skills Highlighted**
- **Noise Modeling:** Understanding common types of image noise.
- **Image Filtering:** Implementing and applying spatial filters for noise reduction.
- **Performance Analysis:** Evaluating the effectiveness of different filters and parameters.
