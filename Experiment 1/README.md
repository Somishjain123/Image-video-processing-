# Experiment 1: Image Processing Basics

This repository contains my foundational lab work for the "Image and Video Processing" course. The aim was to master essential image manipulation techniques.

### **Project Overview**
This experiment covers the basic building blocks of digital image processing, including:
- Reading, displaying, and saving images in various file formats.
- Converting images between different color spaces (color to grayscale, grayscale to binary).
- Analyzing the effect of different gray-level images on their corresponding image matrices.

This serves as a core portfolio piece demonstrating my grasp of fundamental image processing concepts.

### **Repository Contents**
- `experiment-1-ivp.pdf`: The complete lab report, including the theoretical background, procedure, and analysis of results.

### **Skills Highlighted**
- **Image I/O:** Proficiency in handling and managing image files.
- **Color Space Conversion:** Understanding of color models and their conversion.
- **Image Matrix Analysis:** Grasping the underlying data structure of digital images.
