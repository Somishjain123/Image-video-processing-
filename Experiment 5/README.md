# Experiment 5: Sharpening Filters

This repository contains my lab work on image sharpening using high-pass filters. The aim was to enhance edges and fine details in images to improve their visual clarity.

### **Project Overview**
The experiment focused on applying and analyzing sharpening filters, which are based on derivative operations. Key areas of study include:
- **Edge Detection:** Using first-order (Gradient) and second-order (Laplacian) operators to identify areas of rapid intensity change.
- **Image Sharpening:** Applying these operators to enhance the overall sharpness of an image.
- **Visual Analysis:** Observing how different filters affect an image's edges and overall appearance.

### **Repository Contents**
- `experiment-5-ivp.pdf`: The full lab report, detailing the theory of edge detection, the procedures for each task, and the final analysis of the results.

### **Skills Highlighted**
- **Edge Detection:** Understanding and applying derivative-based operators.
- **Image Sharpening:** Implementing high-pass filters to enhance image details.
- **Critical Analysis:** Comparing the performance of different sharpening techniques.
